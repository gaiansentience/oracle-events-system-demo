<footNote>Tickets available for purchase from resellers and directly from the venue.
---
Ticket pricing is determined by the price categories and prices set when ticket groups were created.
---
Reseller Ticket availability for a ticket group per event is determined by the number of tickets assigned to that reseller in the ticket group.
---
When a reseller has sold all tickets in an assigned group they cannot sell any more tickets in that group unless they are assigned additional quantities.
---
Tickets available to purchase directly from the venue are any tickets in each group that have not been assigned to resellers.  
---
If a reseller is not selling their assigned tickets, their assigned quantity can be reduced and either assigned to another reseller or sold directly by the venue.</footNote>
