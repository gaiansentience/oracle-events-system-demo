<footNote>The defined ticket groups for the event are allocated by assigning blocks of tickets to resellers.  Resellers can then sell these tickets to customers.
---
Any unassigned tickets in a ticket group are available for direct purchase from the venue.  
---
The total number of tickets assigned to all resellers cannot exceed the number of tickets available in the ticket group.
---
Assignments to each reseller can be increased or decreased.
---
If a reseller has already sold tickets in the group, their assignment cannot be changed to less than those sales.
---
If the venue makes direct sales for a ticket group, those tickets are not available for assignment to resellers.</footNote>
