<footNote>Customers can purchase available tickets from Resellers or Directly from the venue.  
---
Customers can purchase any quantity of tickets for a ticket group and source up to the number of tickets currently available for that group and source.
---
Customers are added to the system by name and email to record purchases.  This is required to accept a sales transaction.
---
Ticket prices paid were set by the venue organizer when the event ticket groups were created.  The total transaction amount is calculated by multiplying ticket quantity and ticket group price.
---
If the ticket purchase was through a reseller, the commision is calculated at time of sale and recorded with the ticket sales transaction.  Each reseller has a standard commission used for all transactions.
---
Customers cannot purchase more tickets from a source than are currently available from that source.  If there are limited tickets in a group available from a source and two customers try to purchase them only the first customer purchase will succeed.</footNote>
